"""Convenience functions to set up a Python simulation framework.

Such a framework enables you to transparently run a software test suite
on any simulator of choice, provided that the latter is supported by
the framework. It can be used in CIs, regression testing or to conduct
systematic evaluation experiments.

Three interfaces are required to implement a common framework:

1. a test suite specification interface to specify the software tests
2. a command-line interface used to launch the simulations
3. an interface to the simulators supported by the framework

The framework can be divided into three components each managing one of
the defined interfaces:

1. a test suite frontend
2. a command-line frontend
3. a simulation backend

A fourth component, the core, serves to glue all other components
together.

The [parser()][sim_utils.parser] function provides a minimum
command-line interface to control the tool.

The [get_simulations()][sim_utils.get_simulations] function
provides a common means to implement the test suite frontend. At the
input interface it assumes a test suite specification file in YAML
syntax, and returns a list of simulation objects which implement a
common interface to the simulation backend. This interface is defined
by the [Simulation][Simulation.Simulation] class.

The core logic of the framework is implemented in the
[run_simulations()][sim_utils.run_simulations] function. It takes
the output from [get_simulations()][sim_utils.get_simulations] and
launches the simulations through the interface to the simulation
backend.

The simulation backend is implemented by the
[Simulation][Simulation.Simulation] and
[Simulator][Simulator.Simulator] classes and their subclasses.
