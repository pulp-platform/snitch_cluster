# Snitch cluster target

The Snitch cluster target (`target/snitch_cluster`) is a simple RTL testbench
around a Snitch cluster.

The cluster testbench simulates an infinite memory. The RISC-V ELF file to be simulated is
preloaded using RISC-V's Front-End Server (`fesvr`).

You can find information on how to build and simulate the Snitch cluster in the dedicated [tutorial](https://pulp-platform.github.io/snitch_cluster/ug/tutorial.html).
