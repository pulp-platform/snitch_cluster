# Getting Started

Install the Python requirements using:

```
pip3 install --user -r python-requirements.txt
```

## Hardware Development

We use `verible` for style linting. Either build it from [source](https://github.com/google/verible) or - if available for your platform - use one of the [pre-built images](https://github.com/google/verible/releases).
